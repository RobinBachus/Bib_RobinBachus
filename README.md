# Bib_RobinBachus

This is a school project developed as a part of the curriculum. The project is a console application that simulates a library system.

## Features

- Add a new book to the library.
- Add additional information to a book such as publish date, genre, and type.
- Display all information of a book.
- Search for a book by ISBN, author, or price range.
- Remove a book from the library.
- Display all books in the library.
- Load data from a CSV file.

## Classes

- `Library`: Represents a library with a collection of books.
- `Book`: Represents a book with properties like ISBN, author, price, publish date, genre, type, and a mature rating flag.

## Usage

The application starts by asking if you want to load data from a CSV file. If you choose not to, it starts without any books. You can then interact with the library through a menu system. The menu allows you to add a book, add information to a book, display a book's information, search for a book, remove a book, display all books, and load data from a file.

## Note

This project is developed for educational purposes and is part of a school assignment.
